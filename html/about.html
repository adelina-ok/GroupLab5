		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<div> <img src="/images/3ppl.png" alt="my attempt at drawing" height="300" width="1000"></div>
    
    <p style="font-family: Lucida Console"> It all started with a group project . . . </p>
      <br>
		<p style="font-family: Lucida Console">How do you create a restaurant in one week and have it an overnight success? It wasn't an overnight success, it was a few months of hard work and dedication. </br>
    <br> Three group members came back from the war and founded a small, but successful restaurant run by the locals. 
    </br>
    <br>They were looking for a new franchising agent and the group members, addy, nate, and ernesto saw the potential opportunity. </br> 
    <br>In 2020 they founded the Three Amigos Restaurant and bought the exlusive rights from the locals. They bought many mansions and lived happily ever after.
    </br> 
    <br>The Three Amigos leadrship team draws from a proud history and set of values that made the company an icon of American and Mexican business.</br> 
    <br>Exectuive team members who continue to build our legacy and ensure cultures shine bright.</p>

    <h2>Our Community</h2>
    <div> <img src="/images/foood.jpg" alt="foood" height="300" width="1000"></div>
    <br><p style="font-family: Lucida Console">The Three Amigos established simply to feed one community at a time. One of every six Americans face the reality that they may not be able to provide for their next meal. </br>
    <br>The Three Amigos has a unique menu that provides a low cost food that is high quality. There are programs in place that help; however, in Washington, 36 percent of the food insecure population live above the poverty level and recieve no government help.
    </br> 
    <br>Our mission is to feed, educate, and serve our community so they may have a chance to live a healthy life. </br>
    <br>We made a restaurant to provide cultural diversity and bring awareness to how delicious and amazing Mexican dishes are. We believe everyone should have access to healthy, nutritional food. </br>
    <br>Our vision to see our community become the solution to the challenges our community faces when dealing with hunger.</p><br>
